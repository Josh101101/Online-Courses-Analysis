# Online Course Performance Analysis with Power BI

This repository contains the Power BI project files and supporting documentation for an analysis of online course performance. The project aims to provide actionable insights into viewer engagement, course popularity, and the relationship between course features and viewer behavior.  These insights can be used to optimize course content, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding key performance indicators (KPIs) for online courses, including:

* **Course Viewership:** Analyzing viewership trends across different course categories and sub-categories.
* **Viewer Engagement:** Measuring viewer engagement based on lecture duration and other relevant metrics.
* **Instructor Ratings:** Evaluating the impact of instructor ratings on course popularity.
* **Course Content Analysis:** Exploring the relationship between course content (skills covered) and viewer engagement.

## Power BI Dashboard

The interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of online course performance. Key visualizations include:

* **Course Type Popularity:** A bar chart showing the distribution of courses by type (Course vs. Specialization).
* **Average Number of Viewers by Sub-Category and Language:**  Visualizes viewership trends across different sub-categories and languages.
* **Skills Word Cloud:**  A word cloud representing the most frequently covered skills in the online courses.
* **Most Prominent Languages:** A pie chart showing the distribution of courses by language.
* **Average of Number of viewers by Sub-Category and Language:** A bar chart visualizing viewership trends across different sub-categories and languages.

## Key Insights and Findings

[**Note:** Summarize the most important insights you discovered during your analysis.  Quantify your findings whenever possible.  Example:]

* Computer Science courses had significantly higher viewership compared to other categories, particularly in sub-categories like Python Programming and Machine Learning.
* There is a positive correlation between instructor ratings and viewer engagement. Courses with higher instructor ratings tend to have longer average lecture durations and higher viewership.
* The most prominent languages in the courses are English, Spanish, and French.

## Methodology

[**Note:** Briefly describe the steps you took to perform the analysis.  This could include data cleaning, transformation, DAX measures used, etc. Example:]

1. Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. Data Modeling: A star schema was used to model the data in Power BI.
3. DAX Measures: DAX measures were created to calculate KPIs such as average viewership, average lecture duration, and engagement scores.
4. Visualization: Interactive dashboards were designed to visualize the key insights.
